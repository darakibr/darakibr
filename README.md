- Hello, I’m @darakibr, new to GitHub and can be reached on darakibrgithub@gmail.com
- I'm a Biostatistics/Data Science PhD student with planned graduation in 2025.
- I’m interested in Python, R, bash scripting relating to genomics, machine learning, and data science.

- I’m currently learning computational gene analysis, machine learning algorithms, statistics and other bioinformatics techniques.
- I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning in relation to genetic and meta data, and to further my knowledge of data science and biostatistics.
